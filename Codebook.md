## Subject and Activity

These variables identify the unique subject/activity pair the variables relate to:

 - Subject: the integer subject ID.
 - Activity: the string activity name:
  - Walking
  - Walking Upstairs
  - Walking Downstairs
  - Sitting
  - Standing
  - Laying


All variables are the mean of a measurement for each subject and activity. This is indicated by the initial Mean in the variable name. All values are floating point numbers.
